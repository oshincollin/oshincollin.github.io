                        ride in tech. I’ve been a relationship manager, solutions consultant, services sales consultant,
                        <span class="font-bold">product manager</span> and on-the-side <span

                <p class="mt-[25px] text-[20px] leading-[120%] pt-[15px]">It was 2016 and I was at my first job out of
                    school - restructuring consulting at a large public accounting firm.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px] leading-[120%] pt-[15px]"><span class="font-bold">The results were
                        astounding</span> - my client was extremely engaged with the dashboard and used it to regain
                    profitability. The dashboard also helped our accounting firm keep a lifelong client. From that point
                    on I knew I wanted to build things that drove profitability and solved client problems.
                </p>
                <p class="text-[20px] leading-[120%] pt-[15px]"><span class="font-bold">The rest was history.</span> I
                    spent a significant time in tech doing client-facing implementations and project management and
                    eventually taught myself to code and broke into product management. Nowadays I ensure our team is
                    building things that will grow our firm by delighting our customers and solving their problems.

                    some of the things that define my personal PM identity and a few highlighted strengths that I've
                    cultivated throughout my career.</p>

                <p class="text-[20px] leading-[120%] mt-[15px]"><span class="font-bold">Data Analysis -</span> To me,
                    data is priceless. I've spent my career getting good at data analysis. I'm able to analyze data and
                    find pain points, trends and use it as an accurate indicator of what would be most impactful to be
                    built next.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px] leading-[120%] mt-[15px]"><span class="font-bold">Team Focused -</span> “If you
                    want
                    to go fast go alone, if you want to go far, go together.” My team and our cross-functional teams are
                    a huge priority to me. I leverage EQ and attunement to maximize our collective happiness and
                    productivity. In other words, I'm good at getting people (and other teams) to do what I need them to
                    do, without being their boss while keeping everyone happy and productive.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px] leading-[120%] mt-[15px]"><span class="font-bold">Communication - </span> A huge
                    part of my PM role is to be a communication hub. It's critical to ensure that everyone is on the
                    same page all the time - if not, we waste money and time. I've cultivated the ability to communicate
                    in a way that maximizes efficiency but also ensures everyone is on the same page and knows their
                    part in achieving success as a team. </p>
                <p class="text-[20px] leading-[120%] mt-[15px]"><span class="font-bold">Technical & Skills -</span> I've got all of the core product manager technical skills like: agile project management, roadmapping, Jira, SQL and more. The most important PM skill I've cultivated though is knowing what to build and being pragmatic about it. Additionally, if I were to descreibe my flavor of product management I'd have to use some axioms I've been in the PM trenches long enough to internalize: money follows real value, fail fast, YAGNI, perfection is the enemy of done, nail it then scale it, and people get things done not roadmaps or strategy.</p>
